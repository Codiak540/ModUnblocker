# ModUnblocker
Spoofs the client side Mod List


Basically, things like Mod Whitelists will contact the client, and request the mod list from the client, if it finds a mod not on the whitelist, it kicks the client

what this mod does is says "fuck you" and removes any mods present in the config from the list sent to the server when it asks

So, if you want to install Embeddium, but the server kicks you because it has a whitelist, just add Embeddium's Mod ID to the ModUnblocker config
